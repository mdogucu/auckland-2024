## Abstract

Bayesian statistics is becoming more popular in data science.
Data scientists are often not trained in Bayesian statistics and if they
are, it is usually part of their graduate training. During this talk, we
will introduce an introductory course in Bayesian statistics for learners
at the undergraduate level and comparably trained practitioners. We will
share tools for teaching (and learning) the first course in Bayesian
statistics, specifically the {bayesrules} package that accompanies the
open-access Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Bayesian Modeling with R book.
We will provide an outline of the curriculum and examples for novice
learners and their instructors.
