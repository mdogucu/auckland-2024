# Why Teach Bayesian Methods?
1. Intuition

## Hypothesis Testing

Suppose that during a recent doctor’s visit, you tested positive for a very rare disease. 

$H_0$: no disease  
$H_A$: disease

If you only get to ask the doctor one question, which would it be?

a. What’s the chance that I actually have the disease?  
b. If in fact I don’t have the disease, what’s the chance that I would’ve gotten this positive test result?

## Confidence Intervals

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("img/confidence-intervals.png")
```

# Why Teach Bayesian Methods?
2 – Perfect blend of statistics and computing

## Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("img/mh.png")
```

# Why Teach Bayesian Methods?
3 – Bayesian methods are becoming more common

## A quick example

Let $\pi$ be the proportion of spam emails where $\pi \in [0, 1]$.

. . .

What do you think $\pi$ is? How certain are you?

## Prior Model

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=4, fig.alt="X axis reads pi with values from 0 to 1. Y axis reads f of pi). The curve of the graph has a high peak on the y-axis when pi equals to 0.5. The distribution is symmentric."}
plot_beta(alpha = 4, beta = 4)
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=4, fig.alt="X axis reads pi with values from 0 to 1. Y axis reads f of pi). The curve of the graph has a high peak on the y-axis when pi equals to 0. The curve is a concave one and y is decreasing as pi is increasing."}
plot_beta(alpha = 1, beta = 10)
```

:::

::::

## Binomial Likelihood

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=4, fig.alt="X axis reads pi with values from 0 to 1. Y axis reads l of pi given capital Y = y). The curve of the graph has a high peak on the y-axis when pi equals to 0.3. The y-values are almost zero when pi is greater than 0.75."}
plot_binomial_likelihood(y = 3, n = 10)
```


## Posterior Model

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=4, fig.alt="X axis reads pi with values from 0 to 1. Y axis reads density. Three curves are shown labeled as prior, (scaled) likelihood, and posterior. The prior curve of the graph has a high peak on the y-axis when pi equals to 0. The curve is a concave one and y is decreasing as pi is increasing. The likelihood curve has a high peak on the y-axis when pi equals to 0.3. The y-values are almost zero when pi is greater than 0.75. The posterior sits between the prior and likelihood curves."}
plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 1, beta = 10, y = 3, n = 10)
```

## Target Audience of the Book

- Advanced Undergraduate Students in Statistics / Data Science Programs

- Equally trained learners

- Prior course/training in statistics is required

- Familiarity with probability, calculus, and tidyverse is recommended.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", fig.alt="There are two ellipses at the top of the image. The first ellipse reads 'Prior: Only 40% of articles are fake'. The second ellipse reads 'Data: Exclamation points are more common among fake news'. There are two arrows each from the upper two ellipses leading to a third ellipse in the lower part of the image. The third ellipse reads 'Posterior: Is the article fake or not?'"}
